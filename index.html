		<p> Welcome! My name is Jennifer Rice, and I am a Senior Marketing major at The University of Tennessee at Martin. I am learning how to build a website using HTML and CSS. 
I am from a small town north of Nashville, TN. My plans after I graduate is to get my Real Estate license and decide if I would like to get my Architectural degree at Belmont University. 
I have worked for R & R Engineering, LLC since 2012. R & R is a contracting company that installs storage rack systems. I work in the office and do QuickBooks, organizing, and filing, and taking care of getting equipment repaired if needed. I worked at the local YMCA for two years in the childcare. 
In 2014, I started Jennifer Brooke Racing and started the next step into my racing career. I have been racing for 13 years. I started racing junior dragsters at ten years old, and I am now 23 years old, and I just started racing Pro Mod and Radial vs. The World.
